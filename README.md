# INFT-CA3

This repository contains some exploratory quantitative analysis of some different robot traders in the Bristol Stock Exchange simulation using techniques such as market "shocks" and offset functions to create more realistic market conditions. This project was assessed as part of the Intro to Financial Technology (INFT) unit on the Financial Technology with Data Science MSc.

Descriptions of the different trader types - which include ZIP, ZIC, SHVR, GVWY, PRZI and PRSH - can be found in the *Bristol Stock Exchange* repo [here](https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange/wiki "BristolStockExchange").

Data analysis libraries used:

* numPy
